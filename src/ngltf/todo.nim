# material.occlusionTexture : If other channels are present (GBA), they MUST be ignored for occlusion calculations.
# material.occlusionTexture : When undefined, the material does not have an occlusion texture.
# material.emissiveTexture  : If a fourth component (A) is present, it MUST be ignored.
# material.emissiveTexture  : When undefined, the texture MUST be sampled as having 1.0 in RGB components.

#_________________________________________________
# Mesh

#_______________________________________
# Node          : When the node contains skin, all mesh.primitives MUST contain JOINTS_0 and WEIGHTS_0 attributes.
# Node          : A node MAY have either a matrix or any combination of translation/rotation/scale (TRS) properties.
# Node          : TRS properties are converted to matrices and postmultiplied in the T * R * S order to compose the transformation matrix; first the scale is applied to the vertices, then the rotation, and then the translation.
