  ## The name of the node's TRS property to animate, or the `\"weights\"` of the Morph Targets it instantiates.

For the `\"rotation\"` property, the values are a quaternion in the order (x, y, z, w), where w is the scalar. For the `\"scale\"` property, the values are the scaling factors along the X, Y, and Z axes.
